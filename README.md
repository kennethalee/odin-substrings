# Substrings

This Ruby method identifies and counts occurrences of dictionary words within a string.

## Parameters
- **String**: The text to analyze.
- **Array**: A dictionary of words to match.

## Returns
- **Hash**: A hash mapping dictionary words to their occurrence counts.

## Problem Statement
Create a Ruby method that:
1. Accepts a string and dictionary.
2. Counts occurrences of each dictionary word, including substrings.
3. Outputs a hash with word counts.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Ruby Arrays**: For dictionary management.
- **Ruby Hashes**: To store word counts.
- **String Methods**: Use `scan`, `downcase`, and `gsub` for processing.

## Key Takeaways
- Learn array iteration and hash manipulation.
- Use string methods for text analysis.
- Design efficient substring matching algorithms.

## Personal Thoughts
- It was fun, looking at docs and trying new methods.
- S/O to the community for making me realize scan is way more efficient.
